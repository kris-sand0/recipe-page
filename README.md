## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an accessible experience for all users

### Links

- Live Site URL: https://kris-sand0.github.io/recipe-page/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox (for layout and alignment)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom Fonts (`Young Serif` and `Outfit` imported via `@font-face`)

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on:

-   **Semantic HTML Structure:** Organizing content using appropriate HTML5 tags (`<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<table>`) to ensure better accessibility and SEO.
-   **CSS Custom Properties:** Effectively using CSS variables (`:root`) for a maintainable and scalable color palette, making it easy to manage design tokens.
-   **Local Font Imports:** Implementing `@font-face` rules to correctly import and use custom fonts (`Young Serif` and `Outfit`) from local asset files.
-   **Advanced List Styling:** Customizing list item markers and bullets using pseudo-elements (`::before`) and `list-style-type: none` for unique visual designs.
-   **Flexible Table Layouts:** Utilizing Flexbox on table rows (`display: flex; justify-content: space-between;`) to achieve specific column alignments that are not easily done with standard table properties, enhancing visual presentation.
-   **Responsive Design Fundamentals:** Applying a mobile-first approach and using media queries to adapt the layout and styling for different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices.

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to continue focusing on:

-   **Advanced Responsiveness:** Exploring more complex responsive patterns and CSS Grid for more intricate layouts.
-   **Accessibility (A11y):** Deepening my understanding and implementation of ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation to ensure the best possible experience for all users.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Investigating techniques for optimizing asset loading and CSS delivery to improve page load times.
